# Simulating Ball Movement

Practiced building upon a Codio assignment from MITxPro Module 2

It began as one singular black ball bouncing from left to right. We were asked to expand on what the balls could do after a challenging assignment resulted in confusing test results.

## Mission Statement

As a beginner, it helps me write what I'm doing for each new task in detail. I hope my comments help other learners in the future. As I learn, I hope to come back to these and elaborate on them. Feel free to reach out and interact!

## Future Dev

I'll come back to make each small ball bounce at it's own rate and clean up the code. I suspect it could be more DRY

## Wins

* Sometimes it's easier to WET first just to get it working.
* It felt good to remember some CSS
* Feels helpful to clarify the ambiguous information given by the assignment
