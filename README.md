# Simulating Ball Movement

Practiced building upon a Codio assignment from MITxPro Module 2

Began as one singular black ball bouncing from left to right. We were asked to expand on what the balls could do.

## Future Dev

I'll come back to make each small ball bounce at it's own rate and clean up the code. I suspect it could be more DRY

## Wins

* Sometimes it's easier to WET first just to get it working. 
* It felt good to remember some CSS
